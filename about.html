        	<h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am an 18 year old programmer living in Switzerland. In my free time you will probably find me programming, reading or researching a topic I recently learned about. Another big passion of mine are games and their development process, but I can get caught in any material pretty quickly.</p>
            <h1>About this site</h1>
            <p>This site was made to learn something about web development and design. I started working on it in February 2015 as a side project. It will infrequently be updated depending on topics and ideas that find their way to my mind.</p>
            <h1>About you</h1>
            <p>You are the special (beautiful) person that found their way to my humble website. At the moment you are reading the About section on a computer or maybe a phone. In your free time you surf the web looking for personal entertainment and cute looking cats.</p>
            <h1>About this font</h1>
            <p>This is a font mostly used in text editors for programming purposes. I chose it because it resonates with my hobby and job.</p>
            <h1>About the above</h1>
            <p>When I started writing for this about page I didn't know what to tell. I started typing about other topics and kept it. (Because throwing away all that work would be a waste of keystrokes)</p>
